## FAQ

#### The website is empty, is it normal ?
Yes, the site is pretty empty because this project is only at its beginning.

#### Can I use the template for me ?
NO you can't. This template is only for the Elderquest server, you can't use it for your own server. If you want to use it, please contact me on discord (@funoxpanda).
